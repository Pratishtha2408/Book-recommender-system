# Book-recommender-system
Hello everyone, this is book recommendation system made by me with the use of flask,numpy,pandas. It is simple recommendator which on home page shows you top 50 books and a 'recommend' button which will direct you to a new page and then you have to write a book name then it will give you 4 recommendation based on that book.
Here, we've used collabarative filtering to make this.

Thank you.
